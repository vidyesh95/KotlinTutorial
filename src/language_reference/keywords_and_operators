Hard keywords﻿
The following tokens are always interpreted as keywords and cannot be used as identifiers:

as

is used for type casts.

specifies an alias for an import

as? is used for safe type casts.

break terminates the execution of a loop.

class declares a class.

continue proceeds to the next step of the nearest enclosing loop.

else defines the branch of an if expression that is executed when the condition is false.

false specifies the 'false' value of the Boolean type.

for begins a for loop.

fun declares a function.

if begins an if expression.

in

specifies the object being iterated in a for loop.

is used as an infix operator to check that a value belongs to a range, a collection, or another entity that defines a 'contains' method.

is used in when expressions for the same purpose.

marks a type parameter as contravariant.

!in

is used as an operator to check that a value does NOT belong to a range, a collection, or another entity that defines a 'contains' method.

is used in when expressions for the same purpose.

interface declares an interface.

is

checks that a value has a certain type.

is used in when expressions for the same purpose.

!is

checks that a value does NOT have a certain type.

is used in when expressions for the same purpose.

null is a constant representing an object reference that doesn't point to any object.

object declares a class and its instance at the same time.

package specifies the package for the current file.

return returns from the nearest enclosing function or anonymous function.

super

refers to the superclass implementation of a method or property.

calls the superclass constructor from a secondary constructor.

this

refers to the current receiver.

calls another constructor of the same class from a secondary constructor.

throw throws an exception.

true specifies the 'true' value of the Boolean type.

try begins an exception-handling block.

typealias declares a type alias.

typeof is reserved for future use.

val declares a read-only property or local variable.

var declares a mutable property or local variable.

when begins a when expression (executes one of the given branches).

while begins a while loop (a loop with a precondition).

Soft keywords﻿
The following tokens act as keywords in the context in which they are applicable, and they can be used as identifiers in other contexts:

by

delegates the implementation of an interface to another object.

delegates the implementation of the accessors for a property to another object.

catch begins a block that handles a specific exception type.

constructor declares a primary or secondary constructor.

delegate is used as an annotation use-site target.

dynamic references a dynamic type in Kotlin/JS code.

field is used as an annotation use-site target.

file is used as an annotation use-site target.

finally begins a block that is always executed when a try block exits.

get

declares the getter of a property.

is used as an annotation use-site target.

import imports a declaration from another package into the current file.

init begins an initializer block.

param is used as an annotation use-site target.

property is used as an annotation use-site target.

receiveris used as an annotation use-site target.

set

declares the setter of a property.

is used as an annotation use-site target.

setparam is used as an annotation use-site target.

value with the class keyword declares an inline class.

where specifies the constraints for a generic type parameter.

Modifier keywords﻿
The following tokens act as keywords in modifier lists of declarations, and they can be used as identifiers in other contexts:

abstract marks a class or member as abstract.

actual denotes a platform-specific implementation in multiplatform projects.

annotation declares an annotation class.

companion declares a companion object.

const marks a property as a compile-time constant.

crossinline forbids non-local returns in a lambda passed to an inline function.

data instructs the compiler to generate canonical members for a class.

enum declares an enumeration.

expect marks a declaration as platform-specific, expecting an implementation in platform modules.

external marks a declaration as implemented outside of Kotlin (accessible through JNI or in JavaScript).

final forbids overriding a member.

infix allows calling a function using infix notation.

inline tells the compiler to inline a function and the lambdas passed to it at the call site.

inner allows referring to an outer class instance from a nested class.

internal marks a declaration as visible in the current module.

lateinit allows initializing a non-null property outside of a constructor.

noinline turns off inlining of a lambda passed to an inline function.

open allows subclassing a class or overriding a member.

operator marks a function as overloading an operator or implementing a convention.

out marks a type parameter as covariant.

override marks a member as an override of a superclass member.

private marks a declaration as visible in the current class or file.

protected marks a declaration as visible in the current class and its subclasses.

public marks a declaration as visible anywhere.

reified marks a type parameter of an inline function as accessible at runtime.

sealed declares a sealed class (a class with restricted subclassing).

suspend marks a function or lambda as suspending (usable as a coroutine).

tailrec marks a function as tail-recursive (allowing the compiler to replace recursion with iteration).

vararg allows passing a variable number of arguments for a parameter.

Special identifiers﻿
The following identifiers are defined by the compiler in specific contexts, and they can be used as regular identifiers in other contexts:

field is used inside a property accessor to refer to the backing field of the property.

it is used inside a lambda to refer to its parameter implicitly.

Operators and special symbols﻿
Kotlin supports the following operators and special symbols:

+, -, *, /, % - mathematical operators

* is also used to pass an array to a vararg parameter.

=

assignment operator.

is used to specify default values for parameters.

+=, -=, *=, /=, %= - augmented assignment operators.

++, -- - increment and decrement operators.

&&, ||, ! - logical 'and', 'or', 'not' operators (for bitwise operations, use the corresponding infix functions instead).

==, != - equality operators (translated to calls of equals() for non-primitive types).

===, !== - referential equality operators.

<, >, <=, >= - comparison operators (translated to calls of compareTo() for non-primitive types).

[, ] - indexed access operator (translated to calls of get and set).

!! asserts that an expression is non-null.

?. performs a safe call (calls a method or accesses a property if the receiver is non-null).

?: takes the right-hand value if the left-hand value is null (the elvis operator).

:: creates a member reference or a class reference.

.. creates a range.

: separates a name from a type in a declaration.

? marks a type as nullable.

->

separates the parameters and body of a lambda expression.

separates the parameters and return type declaration in a function type.

separates the condition and body of a when expression branch.

@

introduces an annotation.

introduces or references a loop label.

introduces or references a lambda label.

references a 'this' expression from an outer scope.

references an outer superclass.

; separates multiple statements on the same line.

$ references a variable or expression in a string template.

_

substitutes an unused parameter in a lambda expression.

substitutes an unused parameter in a destructuring declaration.
